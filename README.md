# Purpose
The Second Terra Community believes in a community open to everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, preferred operating system, programming language, or text editor.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We urge all sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other participants to help make the event experience safe and enjoyable for all.

# Open Source Citizenship
An additional goal of this code of conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between what we do and the wider community.

In service of this goal, Second Terra will collect nominations from exemplary citizens throughout development and publicly recognize selected entrants on the website.

If you see someone who goes the extra mile to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages everyone to contribute as much as possible, we want to hear about it.

You can nominate someone on our channels or by contacting a member of the organization.

# Expected Behavior
